# RiverCrossingPuzzle (*DFS/BFS*) 🚣‍♀

## Puzzle description 🛶

There are 3 priests and 3 devils on a river shore, and they must all make it across the river using a boat.
The boat can only carry 2 people at most and it doesn't cross the river on its own.

Here's the catch: if a priest is left outnumbered by devils (on shore), you lose.
